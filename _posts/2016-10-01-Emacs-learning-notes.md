C-e         End of line
ESC-<       go to the beginning of the file
ESC->       go to the end of the file
M-m         Move to first non-whitespace character on the line

C-v         Forward a page
M-v         Back a page

C-r         Regex search backwards
M-g g       Go to line
C-j         new line at REPL
```

### Emacs key bindings for Edit commands

```

C-k         kill line
M-d         Kill word forwards
M-delete    Kill word backwards
C-w         Kill region (cut)
M-w         Copy region to kill ring (copy)
M-y         Cycle through kill ring after yanking
C-y         Yank (paste)

C-x C-o     Delete all but one of many consecutive blank lines
C-e RET     Insert new line just below current line
C-shift-backspace Delete current line`
M-Space     delete white space till next word

```

### Emacs key bindings for Misc commands

```
M-x fn-name run commands by name
M-x package-refresh-contents  to get the latest list
M-x package-list-packages     to show package
M-x package-install           to install package
M-%                           Query replace
C-spc                         select region

C-l                           positions the current line in the middle of the screen
```

### Clojure Buffer Key Bindings

```
C-c M-n       Switch to namespace of current buffer
C-c C-k       Compile current buffer
M-. and M-,   Navigate to source code for symbol under point and return to your original buffer
C-↑, C-↓      Cycle through REPL history
C-x C-e       sends the s-exp to the running REPLm, Evaluate expression immediately preceding point 
q             close stack trace
C-c M-o       clear REPL
```

### Paredit
```
M-(   parenthesis-wrap-round
C-→   To slurp, move closing parenthesis to the right to include next expression
C-←   to Barf, move closing parenthesis to the left to exclude last expression
C-M-f, C-M-b Move to the opening/closing parenthesis
C-(   move backward opening parenthesis
C-{   move forward opening parenthesis
C-)   move backward closing parenthesis
C-}   move forward closing parenthesis
