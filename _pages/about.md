When I choose computer engineering as my major and career, I have a deep faith that whenever possible I will create software tools
to make the life of my family, my friends and my own convenient by using my knowledge and talent. That's why I keep exploring
leaning and practicing interesting cutting-edge technologies, which bring a lot fun and challenge my life.
 
As a full-stack software engineering developer, I not only satisfy leveraging my knowledge to create cool software tool, 
but also like to think deeply the essence and natural of problem and related solutions. I pretty enjoy the process of thinking in detail
 and creating new interesting software. This motivation and faith continue keeping my brain excited and pushing forward my limit.
 
Now I am interested in building high-performance, high-concurrent distributed system combined with machine learning to solve problems,
as well as coding in functional programming paradigm by using Scala, clojure and Java 8.
 
Natural science is another part of my life. I never forgot that incredible impression and striking subversion to my way of thinking of our world
 after reading the book 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking when I was in middle school. 
 I was completed fascinated by the beauty and elegant of natural science and always keep eyes on it.
 
 Applied science, big data, machine learning, distributed computing, full-stack, geek and natural science are the keywords in my life.
